  <h1>Does you 3DS's SD slot give you problems? Say no more</h1>
  <h3>I used to have your same problem. I searched online for no result, asked on Discord and received no convincing reply. But having opened two 3DSs several times, I found a solution by myself.</h3>
  <p>This guide will also fix the lack of clicks and an SD card that doesn't stay in place.</p>
  <h2>It is probably the slot's broken plastics, as you can see in the two photos below. Here's how you can fix it</h2><img src="img/0.5%20comparison%20state%20SD%20slot%203DS.webp" alt="comparison state SD slot 3DS"> <img src="img/1%20broken%20sd%20slot%203DS.webp" alt="broken sd slot 3DS">
  <h3>You'll need:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Small x screwdriver (mine says PH00)</li>
    <li>Replacement SD slot (alix). Be careful when buyinh it that it's L shaped.</li>
    <li>Something small to pry open the battery compartment, like a tweezer or a file</li>
    <li>Possibly, some extra screws (ali)</li>

    <h3>Be careful to always apply some pressure</h3>
    <p>Unscrew the four screws from the back and swing the 3DS a bit to get the plate off. <b>Note</b> that these screws won't come off as they're held in place by some clip-in washers.</p>

    <p>Leave the plate on a flat surface to later lay your screws on.</p>

    <img src="img/8%20battery%20removed%203DS.webp" alt="battery removed 3DS">
    <h3>Nice</h3>
    <p>Now read the next step and don't open the 3DS too much or the connectors might break</p>

    <h2>Use something to pry these two connectors from the bottom.</h2>
    <h3>Don't open this compartment too much. The connector on the left is quite shorter than the right one.</h3>
    <p>This step is the most frightnening one. You might want to apply some extra pressure or find the right spot for the best leverage. Don't be scared. Go on.</p>
    <h2>When reassembling, check that the cables don't get stuck. It shouldn't happen but it's a possibility.</h2>
    <h3>The replacement doesn't cost a lot but it's painful to replace.</h3>
    <p>I hope you won't need it, but it's called <i>2pcs L/R Left Right Shoulder Button with Flex Cable Fit for Nintend 3DS Replacement Parts</i> on ali for about â‚¬3.50 (shipping incl.).</p>
    <h2>To reassemble it, place it over its slot and press down.</h2>
    <h3>It clips in surprisingly easily.</h3>

    <p>Now we'll work on the top part. Unscrew any of the highlighted screws.</p>
    <p>I didn't have two of these so I added new ones. Don't worry if you don't have any spares. Take a photo to remember where they were.</p>

    <p>Remove the stylus (if it's in) and then remove the big plastic cover. Simply raise it. If you removed every screw it should come out easily.</p>
    <h3>Remove the old SD slot slider thing and put the new one in place.</h3>
    <p>Don't mess up the easiest step.</p>
    <h2>To reassemble it, simply follow the steps backwards.</h2>

  <p>And don't use the ifixit guide to change the pad.</p>
